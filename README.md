# AWS Bedrock Multi-Agent Blueprint

The AWS Bedrock Multi-Agent Blueprint is a project that allows you to create and deploy multi-agent applications on AWS Bedrock. It is built with the AWS CDK and offers advanced features such as agent collaboration, vector database storage, observability, authentication, and a Streamlit web interface.

Here is a video of the application in action:

## Features

- ü§ñ **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Built with AWS Bedrock Agents including a Supervisor Agent, RAG Agent and Tools Agent working together seamlessly as a multi-agent system
- üîç **Knowledge Base Integration**: Leverages AWS Bedrock Knowledge Base for intelligent processing of PDF documents via RAG
- üîÑ **Tools Calling Integration**: Custom Bedrock Action group for fetching and analyzing relevant clinical trials data from ClinicalTrials.gov using AWS Lambda
- üßÆ **Code Interpreter**: Built-in Code Interpreter capabilities for data analysis and visualization tasks that is able to generate images and HTML code
- üéØ **Prompt Engineering**: Custom prompt templates and configurations for knowledge base responses and orchestration of the Bedrock Agents
- üìä **Vector Database Storage**: Uses Amazon Aurora Vector Store for efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings for RAG
- üìà **Observability**: Built-in monitoring and tracing with LangFuse integration for evaluation, tracing, and cost tracking
- üõ†Ô∏è **Infrastructure as Code**: Complete AWS CDK v2 for TypeScript setup with projen for consistent infrastructure management
- üîê **Authentication**: Integrated Cognito-based authentication system for secure access control to the application via username / password
- üíª **Streamlit App**: Interactive web interface built with Streamlit for easy interaction with the agents deployed to AWS ECS Fargate
- üìö **OpenAPI Schema**: Automatically generated from annotated code of your Lambda function using Lambda Powertools for Bedrock

## Solution Design

## Usage

- Login to your AWS account, go to AWS Bedrock Model catalog in eu-central-1 region and request access to the following models:
  - Titan Text Embeddings V2
  - Claude 3.5 Sonnet V1
- Eventually, you may need to increase your AWS account limits / service quota for Claude [as described here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/quotas.html)
- Register a free LangFuse account for observability at [LangFuse](https://langfuse.com/) and create a new project called `multi-agent-blueprint`. Then create a new AWS Secret named `langfuse/api`  that stores the public and private API key as JSON:
  ```json
  {
    "LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY": "<YOUR_PUBLIC_API_KEY>",
    "LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY": "<YOUR_PRIVATE_API_KEY>"
  }
  ```
- Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html) on your machine, then run the following commands:
  ```bash
  cd infra && npx projen && cd ../
  uv sync --frozen
  uv pip install -r src/app/requirements.dev.txt
  uv pip install -r src/tools/clinicaltrials/requirements.dev.txt
  ```
- Execute the following commands to deploy the infrastructure via AWS CDK:
  ```bash
  cd infra && cdk bootstrap
  DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64 cdk deploy --require-approval never --all
  ```
- In the AWS Console under Bedrock Knowledge Bases, open the created knowledge base and make sure the data source sync is completed, otherwise trigger it manually
- Go to the AWS Console and create a new Cognito user with username and password. Use this to login to the Streamlit app over the HTTP URL that is printed out after the deployment is complete
- For local testing, set the Supervisor Agent ID and Alias ID as well as your LangFuse API keys in the `.vscode/launch.json` file, then run the `APP` launch configuration:
  ```json
  {
    "env": {
      "SUPERVISOR_AGENT_ID": "<YOUR_SUPERVISOR_AGENT_ID>",
      "SUPERVISOR_AGENT_ALIAS_ID": "<YOUR_SUPERVISOR_AGENT_ALIAS_ID>",
      "LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY": "<YOUR_LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY>",
      "LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY": "<YOUR_LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY>"
    }
  }
  ```
- To regenerate the OpenAPI schema from the annotated code of your Lambda function, run the `API SCHEMA` launch configuration. You can find an overview about the implemented functionality [in this PDF](./data/api/Clinical%20Trials%20Bedrock%20API.pdf).

## Possible Improvements
- Add end-to-end agent evaluation using a framework like [AWS Agent Evaluation](https://awslabs.github.io/agent-evaluation/) or [LangFuse Evaluation Pipelines](https://langfuse.com/docs/scores/external-evaluation-pipelines)
- Add a reranker to the knowledge base to improve the quality of the RAG responses as shown in [this code example](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-samples/blob/main/rag/knowledge-bases/features-examples/02-optimizing-accuracy-retrieved-results/re-ranking_using_kb.ipynb)
- Split the application into frontend and backend using FastAPI for the backend server, similar to [this example](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-samples/tree/main/rag/knowledge-bases/features-examples/03-deploying-fastapi-server) that does the same for LangGraph
- Use a prompt router for Anthropic to route the user's query to the most appropriate agent, as explained in [this example](https://github.com/awslabs/generative-ai-cdk-constructs/blob/main/src/cdk-lib/bedrock/README.md#prompt-routing)
